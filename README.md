## Background
I am 30, married and have a energetic 2 year old boy. I am an electrician and working in the building and construction industry
for 13 years. My life evolves around family but i have a passion for AFL football and cricket also. Previous knee reconstructions and surgeries has limited and shutdown my football career. I still enjoy helping my local club though managing one of the teams.


### Interest in IT

I have always had an interest in IT but in my younger age i spent most of my time invested in sporting activities. Now with my 
body not as able as before ive began to spend more time behind a screen and become curious of how the internet, programs, applications,
all come to be. My experience is limited, I completed BIT (Business Inforamtion Technology) subject in high school and set up switches, comms racks through my work for homes and businesses. I see IT guys come in and program rooms and areas I've wired and found their work so much more intruiging. I chose to RMIT to complete a Bachelor of IT and learn these skills and expand my knowledge in a more challenging and rewarding field.
